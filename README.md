# Simulation-Prep-Tutorial-dltBC
walkthrough of preparing a new system for simulating, using dltBC as an example
# Intro and Goals
dltBCDX is a multi-protein complex embedded in the cell wall (membranes?) of (gram-positive?) bacteria and is involved in decorating the outer surface of the cell wall with D-alanine residues. These D-alanines start on the intracellular side and pass through the complex through covalent bonds and modifications. On the extracellular side, they attach to LTAs (lipotechoic acid) and provide the bacteria with a positive charge, which protects the bacteria from (degradation???).

The complex is composed of:
- dltA: uses ATP to adenylate free D-alanine and link it onto dltC's phosphopantethiene group
- dltC: contains ppant-D-ala group which enters into dltB's transmembrane tunnel and potentially interacts with His residues within the central funnel
- dltB: transmembrane protein suspected to not actually directly interact with D-ala, but rather facilitate D-ala in jumping from dltC ontoo dltX
- dltX: binds D-ala with a 6-residue C-terminal motif (highly conserved), specifically the third AA (tyrosine). Transfers D-ala to dltD
- dltD: Putatively binds D-ala via its catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp). Facilitates transfer of D-ala to LTA (via an ester reaction?).
- LTA: the final binding site for D-alanine. Lipotechoic acids decorate the outer cell membrane.
